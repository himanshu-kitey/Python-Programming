DATA TYPE:  class 
ALGORITHM:  function

Even if you want to write smallest of source code:
    1) Define class.
    2) Create data from defined class.
    3) Define function.
    4) Process data by passing it to defined function.

Programming Language:
    1) Some classes are defined by programming language.
    2) Some algorithms (functions) are defined by programming language
    These are known as BUILT IN CLASSES AND BUILT IN FUNCTIONS

EIGHT BUILT IN TYPES:
    (1) bool
    (2) int
    (3) float
    (4) str (string)
    (5) list
    (6) tuple
    (7) dict (dictionary)
    (8) set
Built in functions
    (1) print()
    (2) id()
    (3) type() (technically class)
